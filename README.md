## About this project

This is a way to start a portfolio, instead of just having a resume in a PDF.
In the future, I want this to be the place where you can see all my personal projects.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, install yarn if you don't have it:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Instala todas las dependencias

```bash
yarn
```

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Formatter and linter

To maintain the project well formatted you need to have [Prettier - Code Formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension installed.
You will also need to install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension to make eslint errors visible in vscode.
The vscode settings will take care of the rest.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:
